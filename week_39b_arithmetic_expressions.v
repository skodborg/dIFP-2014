Require Import Arith Bool unfold_tactic.

(* ********** *)

(* Source syntax: *)

Inductive arithmetic_expression : Type :=
  | Lit : nat -> arithmetic_expression
  | Plus : arithmetic_expression -> arithmetic_expression -> arithmetic_expression
  | Times : arithmetic_expression -> arithmetic_expression -> arithmetic_expression.

(* Exercise 0:
   Write samples of arithmetic expressions.
*)

(* ********** *)

Definition specification_of_interpret (interpret : arithmetic_expression -> nat) :=
  (forall n : nat,
     interpret (Lit n) = n)
  /\
  (forall ae1 ae2 : arithmetic_expression,
     interpret (Plus ae1 ae2) = (interpret ae1) + (interpret ae2))
  /\
  (forall ae1 ae2 : arithmetic_expression,
     interpret (Times ae1 ae2) = (interpret ae1) * (interpret ae2)).

(* Exercise 1:
   Write unit tests.
*)

(* Exercise 2:
   Define an interpreter as a function
   that satisfies the specification above
   and verify that it passes the unit tests.
*)

(* Byte-code instructions: *)

Inductive byte_code_instruction : Type :=
  | PUSH : nat -> byte_code_instruction
  | ADD : byte_code_instruction
  | MUL : byte_code_instruction.

(* ********** *)

(* Byte-code programs: *)

Definition byte_code_program := list byte_code_instruction.

(* Data stack: *)

Definition data_stack := list nat.

(* ********** *)

(* Exercise 3:
   specify a function
     execute_byte_code_instruction : instr -> data_stack -> data_stack
   that executes a byte-code instruction, given a data stack
   and returns this stack after the instruction is executed.

   * Executing (PUSH n) given s has the effect of pushing n on s.

   * Executing ADD given s has the effect of popping two numbers
     from s and then pushing the result of adding them.

   * Executing MUL given s has the effect of popping two numbers
     from s and then pushing the result of multiplying them.

   For now, if the stack underflows, just assume it contains zeroes.
*)

(* ********** *)

(* Exercise 4:
   Define a function
     execute_byte_code_program : byte_code_program -> data_stack -> data_stack
   that executes a given byte-code program on a given data stack,
   and returns this stack after the program is executed.
*)

(* ********** *)

(* Exercise 5:
   Prove that for all programs p1, p2 and data stacks s,
   executing (p1 ++ p2) with s
   gives the same result as
   (1) executing p1 with s, and then
   (2) executing p2 with the resulting stack.
*)

(* ********** *)

Definition specification_of_compile (compile : arithmetic_expression -> byte_code_program) :=
  (forall n : nat,
     compile (Lit n) = PUSH n :: nil)
  /\
  (forall ae1 ae2 : arithmetic_expression,
     compile (Plus ae1 ae2) = (compile ae1) ++ (compile ae2) ++ (ADD :: nil))
  /\
  (forall ae1 ae2 : arithmetic_expression,
     compile (Times ae1 ae2) = (compile ae1) ++ (compile ae2)++ (MUL :: nil)).

(* Exercise 6:
   Define a compiler as a function
   that satisfies the specification above
   and uses list concatenation, i.e., ++.
*)

(* Exercise 7:
   Write a compiler as a function with an accumulator
   that does not use ++ but :: instead,
   and prove it equivalent to the compiler of Exercise 6.
*)

(* ********** *)

(* Exercise 8:
   Prove that interpreting an arithmetic expression gives the same result
   as first compiling it and then executing the compiled program
   over an empty data stack.
*)

(* ********** *)

(* Exercise 9:
   Write a Magritte-style execution function for a byte-code program
   that does not operate on natural numbers but on syntactic representations
   of natural numbers:

   Definition data_stack := list arithmetic_expression.

   * Executing (PUSH n) given s has the effect of pushing (Lit n) on s.

   * Executing ADD given s has the effect of popping two arithmetic
     expressions from s and then pushing the syntactic representation of
     their addition.

   * Executing MUL given s has the effect of popping two arithmetic
     expressions from s and then pushing the syntactic representation of
     their multiplication.

   Again, for this week's exercise,
   assume there are enough arithmetic expressions on the data stack.
   If that is not the case, just pad it up with syntactic representations
   of zero.

*)

(* Exercise 10:
   Prove that the Magrite-style execution function from Exercise 9
   implements a decompiler that is the left inverse of the compiler
   of Exercise 6.
*)
